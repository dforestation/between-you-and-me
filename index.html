<div>
     <p>
    tubes and wires and plugs and avatars and usernames and faces and facades
    and glitches and sparks and browsers and images and settings and realities
    and lightning between liminal spaces and neon between pages and loves and 
    regrets and chances and changes and fingerprints on others hands and
    thunder and sunshine and lost spaces and unknowns and creatures and deep
    corners and the power to create and the terrifying reality of being known
    and masks and shadows and bright light and static and time and shape and 
    space and dark matter and glares and walls and ceilings and words and
    plasma and malleability and dismemberment and plasma and stars

  </div>
  
  <p>
    the space between words and suns between settings and investigation and 
    escalation and connections and the chances within them and generosity and
    the edge of the world and explorations and knowledge and planets and 
    exorcism and motion and unreality and tapestry and drawing and views and 
    knowing and not knowing and seeing and not seeing and 
    the top and dust and fire and ash and secrets and advice and operation
    desperation and missing and grieving and living and creating and streams
    and trains and cloudy days and homes and bedrooms and believing and lying
    and losing and stealing and the end of time
